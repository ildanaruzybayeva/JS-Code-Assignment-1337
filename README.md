<h1>3Ô∏è‚É£ _thoughts behind the code</h1>

I have chosen to approach the task using React library for the following reasons:

<b>First</b>, React allows to build <b>complex scalable UIs</b> faster than vanilla JS. This has enabled me to cover most of the design/accessebility points fairly quickly in a structured manner. <b>The app has the following components: Heder, Person, People and Pagination.</b> The state is controlled in People.js component which is responsible for fetching API data and sending info to child components through props.

<b>Secondly</b>, since the app doesn't yet have filter tools and search bar, <b>sorting people by name and office on load time</b> was a must. It helps any user to navigate through the names when looking for a person. <b>The sorting function is located in helpers folder which can be further used to add other sorting and filtering methods</b>. The app has pagination implemented where only first 12 people are displayed from the API array.

<b>Finally</b>, React has <b>in-built testing and deployment tools</b> which were utilised to do unit testing and deploy the website to a publicly available url.
